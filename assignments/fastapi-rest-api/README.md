# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create a simple API for managing a collection of items, practicing endpoint creation, request handling, and response formatting.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new Python project with FastAPI and Uvicorn. Create a basic FastAPI app that runs a simple "Hello, world!" endpoint.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main Python file (e.g., main.py)
- Define a root endpoint ("/") that returns a welcome message


### 🛠️ Task 2: Implement CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Expand your FastAPI app to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a list of items (e.g., books, tasks, or products).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define an Item model using Pydantic
- Implement endpoints to create, read (all and by ID), update, and delete items
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses


### 🛠️ Task 3: Test Your API

#### Description
Test your API using curl, HTTPie, or a tool like Postman. Document example requests and responses in your README.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Include at least one example request/response for each endpoint
- Document how to run and test the API
- Use clear, student-friendly language throughout
